Use the `tracking` prop to adjust letter spacing for text. Negative values tighten spacing, positive values loosen it, and numeric tokens work alongside size and variant changes.

- Combine tracking with different `size` values to balance compact and spacious typography.
- Headings can use subtle negative tracking for denser compositions.
- Uppercase text often benefits from wider tracking to maintain legibility.
