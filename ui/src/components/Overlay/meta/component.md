The Overlay component provides a Mantine-inspired utility for dimming background content or drawing focus to foreground elements. It supports theme-aware colors, configurable opacity, gradients, and blur to achieve anything from subtle scrims to dramatic glassmorphism. Because Overlay is non-interactive by default, pair it with focus traps or dismiss controls when building dialogs, sheets, or other blocking surfaces.
