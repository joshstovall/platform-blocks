The `TableOfContents` component automatically discovers headings on the page (h1–h6) and renders a navigable outline with active section tracking. It supports scroll‑spy highlighting, deep-link copying, custom initial data (SSR / virtual docs), indentation control, appearance variants, and external active state notifications.
