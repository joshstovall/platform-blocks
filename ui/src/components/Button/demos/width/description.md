# Width Demo

This demo showcases different ways to control button width using the new `w` prop (shorthand for `width`) and existing width-related props.

## Usage

- `w={200}` - Sets a fixed width of 200 pixels
- `w="50%"` - Sets width to 50% of parent container
- `width={150}` - Traditional width prop (takes precedence over `w`)
- `fullWidth` - Makes button fill the full width of its parent

The `w` prop is a convenient shorthand for the `width` prop, following the same pattern as spacing props (`m`, `p`, `mt`, etc.).
