The QRCode component generates QR codes for encoding text, URLs, or other data. Supports customization of size, colors, quiet zones, error correction, and various rendering options.

## Key capabilities

- Full UTF-8 payload support so international characters and emoji render reliably.
- Automatic version selection up to Version 40 (177Ã—177 modules) based on payload and error level.
- Default quiet zone of 4 modules applied consistently to improve scanner legibility (customizable via `quietZone`).
