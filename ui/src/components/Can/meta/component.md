The Can component provides conditional rendering based on user permissions and abilities. It integrates with permission systems to show or hide UI elements based on what the current user is allowed to do.

## Features

- **Permission-based rendering**: Show/hide components based on user abilities
- **Role-based access control**: Support for complex permission systems
- **Flexible ability definitions**: Define custom permissions and rules
- **Fallback UI**: Optional fallback content when permission is denied
- **Type-safe**: Full TypeScript support with typed permissions
- **Context integration**: Works with permission providers and contexts

## Use Cases

- Hiding admin features from regular users
- Showing different UI based on subscription levels
- Conditional rendering based on feature flags
- Role-based navigation menus
- Permission-gated actions and buttons
