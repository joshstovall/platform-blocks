The Slider component allows users to select a value or range of values by moving a handle along a track. Supports single values, ranges, vertical layouts, and rich customization hooks.

## Customization

- `colorScheme` lets you swap the active track, thumb, and tick colors to any theme palette or custom hex value.
- `trackSize` and `thumbSize` override the default sizing tokens for denser UIs or highly tactile controls.
- `trackStyle`, `activeTrackStyle`, and `thumbStyle` accept React Native `ViewStyle` objects so you can add borders, shadows, or gradients.
- `tickColor` and `activeTickColor` give fine-grained control over tick marks to match product branding or stateful sliders.
