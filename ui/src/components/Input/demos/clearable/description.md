# Clearable Input

The clearable prop adds a small close button inside the input that allows users to quickly clear the input value.

## Key Features

- **Automatic visibility**: Clear button only appears when input has content
- **Compact design**: Small icon (14px) that fits within input height
- **Accessible**: Proper accessibility labels and keyboard navigation
- **Works with all sizes**: Consistent behavior across all input sizes
- **Integrates with right sections**: Can coexist with other right section content

## When to Use

- Forms where users might want to quickly reset fields
- Search inputs for easy clearing
- Any input where clearing content is a common action

## Implementation Notes

The clear button uses a compact design with negative margins to ensure it doesn't affect the input's height, maintaining consistent visual alignment across different input sizes.
