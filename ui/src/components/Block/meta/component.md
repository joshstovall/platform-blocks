The Block component provides a consistent API for styling, spacing, and layout while supporting polymorphic rendering (can render as any HTML element or React component). It includes built-in spacing utilities, flexbox controls, theming support, and accessibility features.

Key features include spacing shorthand props, layout utilities, consistent theming, polymorphic rendering, and full accessibility support.
