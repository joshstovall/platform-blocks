Interactive input for selecting a time value with hour/minute (and optional seconds) precision. Opens a modal dialog (parity with `DatePicker`) for a consistent selection experience. Supports 12-hour or 24-hour clocks, manual text entry, and custom step intervals for minutes and seconds. Works in controlled and uncontrolled modes.
