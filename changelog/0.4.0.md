## Breaking Changes
- Removed the legacy `Alert`, `Container`, `Accessibility`, `Disclaimer`, `PressAnimation`, `Reveal`, and `Forms` components from the public surface; the few remaining internal helpers now live under `@platform-blocks/ui/components/_internal/*`. Migrate to the new `Notice` component or re-export your own wrappers if you still need the older APIs.
- The docs build now serves SEO artifacts (`robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, `llms.txt`, `og-image.jpg`) from `docs/public`. Update any custom hosting or CDN rules to make those files public.
- Deleted `TitleRegistryContext`, `useTitleRegistration`, and other deprecated hook entry points; keep importing hooks from `@platform-blocks/ui` rather than deep-linking to the files that were removed.
- Retired the hard-coded playground components in `docs/components/playground/*` (ButtonPlayground, LayoutPlayground, etc.) in favor of the registry-driven `ComponentPlayground`; remove any direct imports of the deleted components.

## UI Package (@platform-blocks/ui)
- Introduced `Notice`, a flexible replacement for `Alert` that supports severity-aware defaults, light/filled/outline/subtle variants, optional icons, close buttons, and full-width banners across web and native.
- Rebuilt `Knob` with the new `appearance`/`interaction` system (layer-level styling, partial arcs, pointer + progress controls, multi-gesture input) plus extensive demos, README, and customization spec to document the behavior.
- Reworked `QRCode` rendering to use an internal encoder, support rounded/diamond modules, gradients, portal logos, and graceful error fallbacks; added a dedicated test suite to keep regressions out.
- Added the shared `Collapse` primitive and refit `Accordion`, `Spoiler`, and `Tree` to use it so that expand/collapse timing, easing, and fade behavior remain consistent across components.
- Hardened optional dependency loading through the centralized `resolveOptionalModule` cache and migrated hooks such as `useClipboard`, `useHotkeys`, `useMaskedInput`, `useHaptics`, `useDeviceInfo`, and `useSpotlightToggle` into their own folders with metadata + demos, making the docs pipeline aware of first-party hooks.
- Polished dozens of components and demos: new `chart-sparkline` icon assets, a `caption` text variant (with matching tests), web-only `Radio` keyboard fixes, ColorPicker style cleanups, updated App Store badges/buttons, refreshed markdown + gradient docs, and brand-new Jest coverage across Accordion, Breadcrumbs, Card, Checkbox, Dialog, Divider, Grid, Indicator, Menu, Overlay, Popover, Progress, QRCode, Radio, Ring, SegmentedControl, Select, ShimmerText, Skeleton, Slider, Space, Spoiler, Spotlight, Stepper, Tabs, Title, Toggle, Tooltip, Tree, and more.

## Charts Package (@platform-blocks/charts)
- Expanded `ChartInteractionProvider` with portal-aware popovers, sticky crosshairs, pointer/crosshair throttling, wheel zoom controls, and follow modes so charts remain responsive on both touch and desktop pointer devices.
- Updated `ChartPopover` to animate toward pointer coordinates, optionally render inside `document.body`, and better format candlestick, bubble, histogram, funnel, radar, and violin data via the enriched metadata supplied by each series.
- Rebuilt `useTooltipAggregator` to combine crosshair distance + pointer offset, cap series counts, and expose shared anchors that all Cartesian charts (Bar, Line, Scatter, Histogram, Violin, Combo, Donut, etc.) now feed to eliminate mismatched tooltips.
- Synced every chart component to the new interaction contracts—fixing clipped padding, improving grouped/stacked hover alignment, and wiring up the docs’ `DOCS_CHART_INTERACTION_CONFIG` so previews feel identical to production usage.

## Documentation & Site
- Adopted a new `docsLayout` shell with AppShell support: upgraded header (language toggle, Spotlight trigger, GitHub shortcut), collapsible desktop nav, mobile navbar + bottom bar, floating theme actions, keyboard focus restoration, and localization strings for en/es/fr.
- Component detail pages now include the dynamic `ComponentPlayground`, consolidated “showcase” previews, a smarter `DemoRenderer`, persistent scrolling via `PageLayout`, and the `CopyPageMenu` button that copies Markdown or opens ChatGPT/Claude with page context.
- Hooks received first-class coverage: `scripts/generate-demos` emits hook metadata/code, `hooksLoader` exposes it to the app, `/hooks` lists and filters entries, `/hooks/[hookName]` renders dedicated detail screens, and a comprehensive `useDeviceInfo` hook documents runtime/platform heuristics.
- Refreshed the example apps and doc content (Accessibility, Finder, Music Player, Photo Gallery, Settings, Social Feed, etc.), added breadcrumb helpers, standardized section headers (`DocsPageHeader`), and wired every page through the updated layout wrappers.
- SEO + sharing improvements: `app/+html.tsx` now stamps full meta tags, the Expo export pipeline injects them into the static bundle, `docs/public` ships robots/sitemap/llms assets, `CopyPageMenu` exposes copy/share actions, and chart playgrounds use the shared interaction config for stable previews.

## Tooling & Release
- `scripts/generate-demos.ts` now parses hook directories alongside UI/charts components, emits code maps + metadata for every entry, and flags doc coverage gaps during generation.
- Added `scripts/generate-sitemap.ts`, `scripts/generate-llms.ts`, `docs/scripts/inject-seo-tags.ts`, and `docs/scripts/check-prerender.ts` so the docs build can produce crawlable HTML, verify prerender output, and capture a trimmed knowledge base for LLM ingestion.
- `docs/package.json` gained `generate-seo`, `build-web`, `inject-seo`, `check-prerender`, and preview helpers; the top-level `publish-release.ts` now runs the SEO pipeline before bumping/publishing packages to guarantee fresh sitemap + llms artifacts.
- Repository tooling picked up path aliases in `tsconfig.json`, refreshed ESLint/Jest setups inside `ui/`, and tighter package scripts (`verify:packages`, `site:build`) to keep CI/CD reproducible.

- Replace any `Alert` usages with `Notice` (or your own wrapper) and remove imports for `Container`, `PressAnimation`, `Reveal`, `Accessibility`, `Disclaimer`, and the legacy form helpers—they no longer ship as public exports.
- If you load optional native modules (expo-clipboard, expo-haptics, linear gradient, etc.), rely on `resolveOptionalModule` instead of calling `require` yourself so the guardrails and caching stay consistent.
- When hosting the docs, make sure the contents of `docs/public` are served as-is and update release automation to run `npm run generate-seo --workspace=docs` so the sitemap/llms files stay current.
- Swap any references to the removed playground files with the new `ComponentPlayground` registry (or embed the `showcase` helpers) to keep the `/components/[name]#playground` tab functioning.
