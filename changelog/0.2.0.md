## UI Package (@platform-blocks/ui)

- Relaxed peer dependency ranges to allow React 18+ and React Native 0.73+ projects to install without version conflicts.
- Moved Expo-driven features (audio, document picker, gradients, haptics, status bar) and supporting libraries to optional peer dependencies so apps can supply matching versions.
- Implemented runtime fallbacks for gradient, shimmer, button, container, and file input components so they keep working when optional Expo modules are missing.
- Introduced a reusable `Highlight` component for substring emphasis and adopted it in AutoComplete suggestion rendering.
- Added a dedicated `highlight` icon glyph so docs and components referencing the symbol render correctly.
- Added a dedicated `popover` icon to keep the docs icon registry in sync with new navigation items.
- Documented required and optional peers along with a quick-start usage example.
- Added `Popover` component
- `Spotlight` component now supports highlighting of text matches
- Fixed shadow warnings

## Charts Package (@platform-blocks/charts)

- Broadened peer dependency support for React 18+ and modern React Native releases, reducing install friction.
- Dropped the hard `react-dom` and `@platform-blocks/ui` coupling; `react-dom` remains an optional peer for web tooltips.
- Added documentation covering compatibility expectations and shared popover setup.
- Fixed shadow warnings.
