## Fixes

### Dialog: Bottom Sheet Pan Responder Fix
- Fixed pan responder behavior for the bottom sheet variant to prevent gesture conflicts with child interactive elements (buttons, pressables)
- Previously, the capture phase would immediately claim gestures on touch start, which could block taps on child elements like buttons inside the bottom sheet
- Now the pan responder only claims gestures in the bubble phase, allowing child components to handle their own touch events first
- Swipe-to-dismiss still works as expected when touching empty space or the drag handle

## Improvements

### StyleProp Type Flexibility
- Updated style prop types across 38+ components to use `StyleProp<ViewStyle>` and `StyleProp<TextStyle>` instead of `ViewStyle` and `TextStyle` directly
- This allows passing arrays, `false`, `null`, `undefined`, or registered style references as style values — matching React Native's standard style prop pattern
- **Affected components:** Accordion, AutoComplete, Avatar, Badge, Block, Blockquote, Breadcrumbs, Calendar, Carousel, Chip, CodeBlock, ColorPicker, CopyButton, DatePicker, Divider, Grid, HoverCard, Image, Indicator, Knob, ListGroup, Loader, Masonry, Navigation, Notice, Pagination, Progress, QRCode, Rating, Ring, SegmentedControl, Skeleton, Slider, Spotlight, Tabs, Toast, Tooltip, Video

### setTimeout Type Compatibility
- Fixed `setTimeout` return type for cross-platform TypeScript compatibility
