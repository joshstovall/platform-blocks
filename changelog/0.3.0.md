## UI Package (@platform-blocks/ui)

- Introduced a global `KeyboardManagerProvider` along with optional `keyboardFocusId` support so inputs, pickers, and overlays can coordinate refocus without dropping the keyboard. A new `KeyboardAwareLayout` component wraps forms to automatically pad for the current keyboard height on web and native.
- Rebuilt overlay selection flows (`handleSelectionComplete`, `useOverlayApi`) and adopted them in `Select`, `AutoComplete`, `NumberInput`, and other inputs. This fixes the lingering overlay hook regressions and keeps focus stable after picks or clears.
- Added hold-friendly controls to `NumberInput`: optional side buttons, shift-click multipliers, refined continuous stepping behaviour, and fresh side-button demos that call out the new ergonomics.
- Upgraded `Select` and `AutoComplete` positioning to share the dropdown positioning hook, restored overlay exports, and tightened accessibility defaults (`aria`/role wiring, labels, keyboard navigation).
- Delivered a fully featured `Knob` component: support for marks with labels, endless mode, text selection suppression on web, and new documentation/demo coverage.
- Replaced the legacy `TimePicker` implementation with `TimePickerInput`, adding second-level precision, configurable columns, and direct re-export via `TimePicker` for backwards compatibility.
- Hardened optional dependency loading with the new `resolveOptionalModule` helper, refreshed component sizing utilities (including the new `ComponentSizeValue` union + clamp helpers), and synced icon registries so apps no longer need to patch missing glyphs.

## Charts Package (@platform-blocks/charts)

- Shipped two new data visualisations: `ParetoChart` for cumulative distribution analysis and `MarimekkoChart` for weighted categorical comparisons. Each includes typed props, themed demos, and metadata for the docs site.
- Updated `ChartPopover`, `ChartBase`, and provider interactions to accommodate stacked categories, shared hover state, and the new weighted layouts.
- Expanded chart typings and exports so mixed-series dashboards can consume the new components without manual wiring.

## Documentation & Examples

- Added a dedicated "Keyboard Management" guide describing the provider, layout wrapper, and migration tips. The docs shell now wraps all pages in `KeyboardManagerProvider` and `KeyboardAwareLayout` to mirror production usage.
- Refreshed major example apps (Dashboard, Finder, Music Player, Ecommerce, Todo, DAW) to demonstrate the latest component APIs, streamlined keyboard behaviour, and updated spacing defaults.
- Published new demos covering Card variants, multiple NumberInput scenarios (basic formatter, drag gestures, side buttons), Knob endless mode, and the Pareto/Marimekko charts; removed outdated keyboard roadmap content in favour of the new guide.

## Migration Notes

- Wrap your host app with `KeyboardManagerProvider` to opt into the shared keyboard state. Set `EXPO_PUBLIC_ENABLE_KEYBOARD_MANAGER=false` temporarily if you need to defer rollout.
- Verify native applications that depend on Select, AutoComplete, NumberInput, or the new TimePicker flows—the keyboard focus behaviour has changed and should be smoke-tested before shipping to production.
