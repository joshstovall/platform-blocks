**Story focus**
- Tracks how a marketing push shifts audience attention across Originals, TV, film, and live sports week-by-week.
- Highlights the share-based stack so teams can see when new content overtakes legacy catalog minutes.
- Surfaces total minute contribution per category inside the tooltip for quick campaign readouts.

**Key settings**
- Uses `layout="stackedPercentage"` to normalize each week to 100% share.
- Keeps dashed gridlines and a centered legend for comparative scanning.
- Custom tooltip blends absolute minutes with share-of-week for richer context.
